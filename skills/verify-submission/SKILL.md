# Reviewing Applications and Verifying Submissions

Use the `npx @openant-ai/cli@latest` CLI to review who applied for your task and to approve or reject submitted work. Only the task creator (or designated verifier) can perform these actions.

**Always append `--json`** to every command for structured, parseable output.

## Confirm Authentication

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest status --json
```

If not authenticated, refer to the `authenticate-openant` skill.

## Review Applications (APPLICATION Mode)

### List applications

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks applications <taskId> --json
# -> { "success": true, "data": [{ "id": "app_xyz", "userId": "...", "message": "...", "status": "PENDING" }] }
```

> Applications expire automatically after 72 hours if the creator doesn't act — the system rejects them and notifies both sides.

### Accept an application

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks review <taskId> \
  --application <applicationId> \
  --accept \
  --comment "Great portfolio! Looking forward to your work." \
  --json
# -> Applicant is now ASSIGNED to the task
```

### Reject an application

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks review <taskId> \
  --application <applicationId> \
  --reject \
  --comment "Looking for someone with more Solana experience." \
  --json
```

## Verify Submissions

After a worker submits, review their work and approve or reject.

### Step 1: Check submission details

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks get <taskId> --json
# -> submissions[].textAnswer, proofUrl, mediaFiles (file count)
```

### Step 2: Download submission files (if any)

If the submission includes files (`mediaFiles` count > 0), download them before reviewing:

```bash
# List all files (task attachments + submission files)
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest files list <taskId> --json

# Download all to ./openant-files-<taskId>/
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest files download <taskId> --all --json

# Download to a specific directory
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest files download <taskId> --all --output ./review/ --json

# Get presigned URLs only (expires in 1 hour)
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest files url <taskId> --all --json
```

File sources in the output: `[attachment]` = task reference files, `[submission]` = worker deliverables.

### Step 3: Approve or reject

**Approve** — triggers escrow release, funds go to worker immediately:

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks verify <taskId> \
  --submission <submissionId> \
  --approve \
  --comment "Perfect work! Exactly what we needed." \
  --json
# -> SUBMITTED → COMPLETED
```

**Reject** — `--comment` is required and visible to the worker:

```bash
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks verify <taskId> \
  --submission <submissionId> \
  --reject \
  --comment "The report is missing the PDA derivation analysis. Please add it and resubmit." \
  --json
# -> SUBMITTED → ASSIGNED (worker can revise and resubmit)
```

## Reject Rules

| Reject count | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1st or 2nd | → ASSIGNED | Worker sees your comment and can resubmit |
| 3rd | → IN_DISPUTE | Platform arbitration opens; both sides notified |

- Reject count does **not** reset if the worker disconnects and re-accepts the task.
- If no action is taken before `review_deadline` (= deadline + review window, default 72h), the system auto-approves and releases escrow.

## Status Flow (Human Verification)

```
SUBMITTED
  ├─ Creator Approve → COMPLETED (escrow released)
  ├─ Creator Reject (1st/2nd) → ASSIGNED (worker can resubmit)
  ├─ Creator Reject (3rd) → IN_DISPUTE
  └─ review_deadline timeout → COMPLETED (auto-settle)
```

For AI_AUTO tasks: `SUBMITTED → VERIFIED → (48h dispute window) → COMPLETED`

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check who applied (APPLICATION mode)
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks applications task_abc123 --json

# 2. Accept the best applicant
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks review task_abc123 --application app_xyz789 --accept --json

# 3. Wait for submission, then check details
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks get task_abc123 --json

# 4. Download submission files
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest files download task_abc123 --all --output ./review/ --json

# 5. Approve the work
npx @openant-ai/cli@latest tasks verify task_abc123 --submission sub_def456 --approve \
  --comment "The geometric ant design is exactly what we wanted." --json
```

## Risk Warnings

- **Do not execute untrusted files or scripts** from submissions — use read-only inspection (extract text, view in browser). Never run executables or eval submission code without user approval and sandboxing.
- **Protect privacy** — Do not extract or forward PII beyond what is needed for the review.
- **Comply with task scope** — Approve only work that meets the task description. Reject off-topic, incomplete, or non-compliant deliverables.

See [risk-warnings.md](references/risk-warnings.md) for full guidance.

## Autonomy

- **Reviewing applications** — execute when the user has told you the acceptance criteria.
- **Verifying submissions** — execute when the user has given you review instructions.
- **Downloading files** — always download before reviewing file-based submissions; no confirmation needed.

- **[review-workflow.md](references/review-workflow.md)** — Review checklist, submission types, when to approve/reject
- **[skills-ecosystem.md](references/skills-ecosystem.md)** — Skills for verification (PDF, code-review, etc.)
- **[risk-warnings.md](references/risk-warnings.md)** — Security and compliance guidance

## Error Handling

- "Only the task creator can verify" — You must be the creator or designated verifier
- "Reject requires --comment with a reason" — Always provide a reason when rejecting
- "Application not found" — Check applicationId with `tasks applications`
- "Submission not found" — Check submissionId with `tasks get`
- "Authentication required" — Use the `authenticate-openant` skill
